# Welcome to my blog page

## My name is Brandon Nguyen 
### I am currently a senior attending Clear Springs High School
## My favorites:
I like to play basketball during my free time and I look up to various nba players while i am playing

During my free time I am usually hanging out with my friends or in my room playing video games with my friends and cousins.

American and Mexican food is my favorite types of dishes

## What I typically do on a regular school day
Firstly, this year has been extremely different with going online and a global pandemic going on.

Typically, I wake up at around 7:00 and get something to eat before I join my first virtual class.

I go to classes until 7:20-11 and then I'm on lunch break. 

I am pretty lucky as I do not have a 5th period meaning I do not have a class from 11-1.

After, I go to my last class of the day (6th) (Computer Science) 

At the end of the day, I finish up my homework and repeat.

## What I do on the weekends
Typically I am either hanging out with my family and friends or doing school work.

This is my time to rest up and catch up on sleep for the week:)

## The future
I hope to attend the University of Texas at Austin and I have been working on my applications!

### Regarding blogs
I plan to keep this page updated with my life and future. Stay tuned!
